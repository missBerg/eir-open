## Good First Issues

These are high-priority areas where the project needs help:

- **JavaScript parser library** — expand `health-md` parsing beyond Python
- **FHIR integration** — bidirectional conversion between EIR format and FHIR resources
- **Clinical validation studies** — real-world testing and accuracy review
- **EHR integrations** — Epic, Cerner, Allscripts connectors
- **Specialty extensions** — structured sections for cardiology, oncology, mental health

Browse [open issues](https://github.com/eir-space/eir-open/issues) and look for `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels.

## Dev Setup

To run the docs site locally:

git clone https://github.com/eir-space/eir-open.git
cd eir-open/site
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321/eir-open/`.

## Standards

When contributing to eir-open projects:

- **Backward compatibility** — don't break existing Health.md files or CLI interfaces
- **Clinical accuracy** — validate changes with healthcare professionals or cite sources
- **Privacy-first** — always consider data protection implications; never commit real patient data
- **LLM-optimized** — structured output should be easy for AI systems to parse and reason about

<Aside>
  The Health.md Standard has the most detailed contributing guide, including code style, testing requirements, and issue templates. Start there if you are contributing to clinical data standards: [health-md-standard/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/eir-space/health-md-standard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
