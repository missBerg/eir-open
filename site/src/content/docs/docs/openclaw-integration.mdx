Add eir-open medication lookups and health data parsing to your OpenClaw agent. Your AI can then answer medication questions, look up drug interactions, and work with Health.md files.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) installed
- Node.js 18+ (for medication skills)

## Quick install

Add both medication skills with one-liners:

```bash
openclaw skill add us-medications
openclaw skill add swedish-medications
```

## Skill-by-skill

### US Medications

81,212 FDA medications with drug interaction checking.

```bash
# From npm (recommended)
openclaw skill add us-medications

# Or from URL
openclaw skill add https://eir-space.github.io/eir-open/projects/us-medications/skill.md
```

### Swedish Medications

9,064 Swedish pharmaceuticals from FASS with brand-to-substance mapping.

```bash
# From npm (recommended)
openclaw skill add swedish-medications

# Or from URL
openclaw skill add https://eir-space.github.io/eir-open/projects/swedish-medications/skill.md
```

### Health.md Parser

Parse and analyze Health.md files. Requires manual setup:

```bash
pip install health-md pyyaml beautifulsoup4
```

Then add the skill from the [health-md-standard openclaw-skill](/eir-open/docs/health-md-standard/) directory, or configure manually in `~/.openclaw/config.yaml`.

## Config reference

Example `~/.openclaw/config.yaml` with all eir-open skills:

```yaml
skills:
  - us-medications
  - swedish-medications
```

## Verify

Ask your OpenClaw agent:

- "What is paracetamol?" (Swedish Medications)
- "Look up lisinopril" (US Medications)
- "What are the drug interactions for warfarin?" (US Medications)

## Troubleshooting

**OpenClaw not found**

Install OpenClaw first: [openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai)

**Skill not found**

If the package alias is unavailable, add the skill directly from URL:

```bash
openclaw skill add https://eir-space.github.io/eir-open/projects/us-medications/skill.md
# or
openclaw skill add https://eir-space.github.io/eir-open/projects/swedish-medications/skill.md
```

**Node.js version**

Medication skills require Node.js 18+. Check with `node -v`. Install via `brew install node` if needed.

## Skill files

- [US Medications skill.md](/eir-open/projects/us-medications/skill.md)
- [Swedish Medications skill.md](/eir-open/projects/swedish-medications/skill.md)
